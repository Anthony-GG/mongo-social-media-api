# CWRU Bootcamp Challenge 16 - MongoDB Social Media API

## Description
    
### The goal of this project was to create an API for a basic Social Media Website using GET, POST, PUT and DELETE API calls supported by a NOSQL database, MongoDB!
### Behind the scenes, this program heavily relies on MongoDB, which for the end user making the calls, not much changes. But, for the program behind, the syntax changes heavily for specific MongoDB functionality, yet Express is used much the same way to provide the end user with working routes.
